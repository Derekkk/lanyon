I am a master student in Computer Engineering in Northeaster University. My program focus on machine learning, natural language processing, deep learning and their applications.

Before that I spent 4 years in Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications(BUPT), and received my Bachelor degree in Communication Engineering.

Currently Iâ€™m doing CO-OP in Baidu, Inc as NLP intern.
